title: "Digital Cocaine"
---

It's clearer than ever that social media, mobile games and short-form video are completely destroying our ability to focus and do meaningful work. I've seen a huge increase in the number of family members and friends diagnosed with ADHD over the last couple of years. And it's not just young people. It's everyone from kids and teenagers to folks well into their forties. If you've ever spent an hour or two doomscrolling or going down the YouTube rabbit hole, you've had a taste for these addictive substances. It's as though everyone has access to cocaine. On demand. Every single day. And for some reason, we're all kind of okay with it.
