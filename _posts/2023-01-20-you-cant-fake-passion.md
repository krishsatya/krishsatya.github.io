title: "You can't fake passion"
---

You can't fake passion over the long term. You can pretend to be interested in something for a little while, but ultimately your motivation will wane and your curiosity will take you in a different direction. Am I suggesting that one should simply follow their passion? It's more complicated than that.

I think passions are quite ephemeral. Over the course of a year, I might become interested—and eventually lose interest—in lots of different things. That's okay, trying things is fun! It's how I figure out what I'm into. It's also helped me understand how I learn and what things I want to get better at.

I see it as a positive feedback loop:

1. Do the thing
2. Get incrementally better at it
3. Experience the joy of getting better
4. Repeat steps 1 through 3

Focusing excessively on passion is short-term thinking.

When deciding whether to pursue a product idea, for example, I find it helpful to imagine what things might look like five years into the future, well after the sheen has worn off. What will I have learned? Will the challenges be bigger and more nuanced? Will I get to collaborate with people outside of the initial idea space, thus opening me up to new interests? While it's not terribly hard to be starry-eyed about the future too, I find that thinking on a longer timespan forces me to do an internal gut check: can I even see myself working on this for a year, let alone five years??

Truth is, I've fallen into the trap many times myself. I'll get way too excited by an idea and research it like a madman, only to abandon it weeks later. What's worse is sometimes my mind confuses someone else's passion for my own. Anyone who's watched *The Queen's Gambit* knows what it feels like to *want* to be a chess Grand Master. For us mere mortals, reaching GM status would require thousands of hours of intentional study, gameplay and practice. In five years, would I still want to sit down at the chess board to study the weak parts of my game?

That's what it takes to be great: working intelligently and consistently over a long stretch of time. Passion might get you started, but you'll need a positive feedback loop to keep going.
