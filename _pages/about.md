ðŸ‘‹ Welcome! I hope you'll stay a while. My name is Krish and I'm a software developer. I'm using this space to share ideasâ€”both inconsequential and profoundâ€”with my kids. But don't take anything you find here too seriously; I certainly don't. If you're feeling social, let's connect on [Twitter / X](https://twitter.com/mrkrishsatya).
